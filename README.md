# Open file in search editor

This is a Visual Studio Code extension that makes it easily to search in current active editor. It is inspired by the emacs extension helm-swoop. I modifield the original plugin from shibayu36 ("Search in Current File") since I didn't find it necessary to enter the cumbersome left search panel first. These two plugins can live peacefully side by side.
